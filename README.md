# SnippetFetch

## What Project Does:
- It helps in management of all the snippets the person has provides a medium to share, access and work on the pice of code they want in a seamlessly
manner.
- Can be used in firms as it provides an easy way of seeing/accessing one other's code.
- Keeps the Data archived and protected on cloud even in case of any kind of disaster.

## Scope of the project
* This Project has been made in a short time so the functionalities are limited for now, they can be increased in future easily.
* The UI/UX is minimal as the project has been made keeping in mind the backend as the primary goal. This can also be improved easily in future.
* The code is well commented and formatted so tweaks and additions could be easily made.

## Technologies Used

* ReactJS
* BootStrap
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* MongoDB
* JWT Authentication

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
